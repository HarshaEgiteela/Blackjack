🃏 Blackjack Game

This is a Blackjack card game implemented in Python.
I built this project by following instructions from a YouTube tutorial to practice and improve my Python programming skills.

🎯 Objective

The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by getting a hand total as close to 21 as possible without going over.

This project is not entirely my original creation — I developed it while following a tutorial on YouTube.
The tutorial helped me understand concepts like:

Classes and objects

Random module usage

Game logic implementation

Conditional statements and loops


🧠 What I Learned

How to use Python to create an interactive terminal-based game

How to shuffle and deal cards using lists and randomization

How to build game logic such as calculating scores, checking for Blackjack, bust conditions, etc.


🛠 Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Standard libraries (random)


🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.


2. Download the Python file (e.g., blackjack.py).


3. Open a terminal or command prompt.


4. Run the game using:



python blackjack.py
